Small island developing States were heavily affected by two “once-in-a-generation” crises that struck in 2008 and 2020, while grappling with even more intense and frequent disasters and natural hazards. In addition, they have assumed leadership roles in areas such as finance, climate change and plastics, and are stewards of the ocean, including managing 19.1 per cent of the world’s exclusive economic zones and the resources they hold. Small island developing States have paved the way for many of the most progressive movements in these areas in policy development and the establishment of concrete actions in the multilateral arena. </p>

Recognizing vulnerability does not mean that small island developing States exhibit weakness or lack potential for development. Rather, it means recognizing that they are disproportionately impacted in terms of physical destruction and non‑economic and economic losses to a far greater scale than elsewhere.</p>

We take note of the concerns expressed by small island developing States that the impacts of climate change could have possible implications on small island developing States, including humanitarian, economic, social, cultural, ecological and, as exacerbated by other factors, security consequences. </p>

Therefore, the special case of small island developing States must continue to be recognized by the international community and must take into account these new and emerging challenges. </p>
