Greater ambition is required at all levels to address the dire state of the ocean. As leaders and representatives of our Governments, we are determined to act decisively and urgently to improve the health, productivity, sustainable use and resilience of the ocean and its ecosystems. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	We recognize that the ocean is fundamental to life on our planet and to our future. The ocean is an important source of the planet’s biodiversity and plays a vital role in the climate system and water cycle. The ocean provides a range of ecosystem services, supplies us with oxygen to breathe, contributes to food security, nutrition and decent jobs and livelihoods, acts as a sink and reservoir of greenhouse gases and protects biodiversity, provides a means for maritime transportation, including for global trade, forms an important part of our natural and cultural heritage and plays an essential role in sustainable development, a sustainable ocean-based economy and poverty eradication. We underline the interlinkages and potential synergies between Goal 14 and the other Sustainable Development Goals and recognize that the implementation of Goal 14 can contribute significantly to the realization of the 2030 Agenda, which is integrated and indivisible in its nature. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	We are therefore deeply alarmed by the global emergency facing the ocean. Sea levels are rising, coastal erosion is worsening and the ocean is warmer and more acidic. Marine pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, a third of fish stocks are overexploited, marine biodiversity continues to decrease and approximately half of all living coral has been lost, while alien invasive species pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems and resources. While progress has been made towards the achievement of some of the targets of Goal 14, action is not advancing at the speed or scale required to meet our goals. We deeply regret our collective failure to achieve targets 14.2, 14.4, 14.5 and 14.6 that matured in 2020, and we renew our commitment to taking urgent action and to cooperating at the global, regional and subregional levels to achieve all targets as soon as possible without undue delay.</p>

We recall that article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement states that it will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We also emphasize the need to adapt to the unavoidable effects of climate change. We reaffirm the importance of implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact on mitigation, adaptation and the provision and mobilization of finance, technology transfer and capacity-building to developing countries, including small island developing States. We welcome the decision by the parties to the Framework Convention to recognize the importance of protecting, conserving and restoring ecosystems, including marine ecosystems, to deliver crucial services, including acting as sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases, reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts and supporting sustainable livelihoods, including for indigenous peoples and local communities. We further welcome the invitation to relevant work programmes and constituted bodies under the Framework Convention to consider how to integrate and strengthen ocean-based action in relevant mandates and workplans and the invitation to the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice to hold an annual dialogue to strengthen ocean-based action. </p>

We recognize the need for transformative change and are committed to halting and reversing the decline in the health of the ocean’s ecosystems and biodiversity and to protecting and restoring its resilience and ecological integrity. We call for an ambitious, balanced, practical, effective, robust and transformative post-2020 global biodiversity framework for adoption at the second part of the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. We take note of the voluntary commitments by more than 100 Member States to conserve or protect at least 30 per cent of the global ocean within marine protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures by 2030. We emphasize that strong governance and adequate financing for developing countries, in particular small island developing States, is essential to effectively implement and maintain such areas and measures. We also recognize the importance of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) and its call to support and scale up efforts to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems worldwide. </p>
