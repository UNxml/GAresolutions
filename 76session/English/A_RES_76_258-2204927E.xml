The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequality, human rights violations, digital divides, vaccine divides, complex humanitarian emergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, climate change and disasters. Of greatest concern is that one in three people in least developed countries still live in extreme poverty, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused this figure to rise further. We are determined to foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies that are free from fear and violence. There can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	The least developed countries saw their economies significantly shrink in 2020, amid a severe global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The external debt burden and debt service obligations are rising significantly, gains made over the past decade in poverty reduction were wiped out, there were increases in food insecurity and malnutrition, and already fragile health systems saw resources shifted away from urgent health and life-saving treatments. Disrupted education is likely to have a lasting negative impact on countries’ recovery and development. Global inequalities are being exposed and growing as a result of the pandemic, increasing the risk of conflict and fragility, with women and girls, young people, persons with disabilities, older persons, indigenous peoples, local communities, refugees, displaced persons and migrants disproportionately affected. While many advanced economies deployed massive fiscal stimuli to cushion the pandemic’s impact and have applied adjusted health measures, the policy response in least developed countries was much more limited owing to weak fiscal conditions, major supply chain and logistic challenges, weak resilience capacity and static global support. For them, adequate access to vaccines remains many months, if not years, away, casting a shadow over their urgent and much-needed growth and development prospects. </p>

Global inequality has risen as a result of the pandemic, and the risk of conflict and fragility has increased, in particular in relation to democratic governance and the rule of law. Owing to pre‑existing conditions, namely, chronic underinvestment in health systems, poorly functioning food systems, weak social protection systems, lack of institutional capacity, high levels of vulnerability to external shocks and employment that is predominantly in the informal sector, the pandemic has caused serious negative effects on all priority areas of the Istanbul Programme of Action that will be felt for years to come.

Almost half of the least developed countries are landlocked or small island countries, with a weak land and natural resource base. These long-standing challenges are compounded by new and emerging challenges, brought about by climate change, increased incidences of disasters and public health emergencies, conflicts, fluctuating commodity prices and rising capital outflows. Without a structural transformation that prioritizes economic diversification and addresses institutional and capacity constraints, the least developed countries will remain vulnerable to various socioeconomic, health and environmental shocks. </p>

Access to energy and broadband connectivity is moving at a slower pace. Structural transformation is not taking hold. Infrastructure investment and equitable access to infrastructure services are falling far behind actual needs. Productive capacity and export competitiveness are weak. Climate change is occurring much faster than anticipated, as evidenced by, inter alia, disproportionately high levels of economic losses, damage to critical infrastructure, disruption of basic services in the least developed countries, devastating impacts on oceans and seas, loss of vulnerable ecosystems, land degradation, the retreat of mountain glaciers and the continued rise in global temperatures, thereby threatening the lives of many people, in particular the poorest and people in vulnerable situations.

School closures resulting from the pandemic have had devastating consequences for children’s learning and well-being. Millions of children and young people are falling behind in their learning, making it even more difficult to successfully make the transition from education and training to employment, which will have long-term impacts on human capital, including reduced earnings and career advancement. More than a year and a half into the COVID-19 crisis, almost all learners in least developed countries have faced full school closures, which has also deprived them of childcare, school meals and other vital school health services. In particular, the crisis poses a series of mental health challenges to young people and may aggravate the state of those with pre-existing mental health conditions. These children, especially girls, who are unable to gain access to quality remote learning and who face economic hardship are at an increased risk of never returning to school and even of being subject to harmful practices, including child labour and child, early and forced marriage. The situation of young girls is particularly alarming because they are more vulnerable and exposed to the risks of exploitation, including the risk of early pregnancies. In addition, the pandemic threatens to undo many of the global gains of the last two decades in girls’ education and employment. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	Women and girls continue to face barriers, such as a lack of access to inclusive and quality education and digital skills, in particular at the secondary and tertiary levels, to health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, and to social protection, decent work and opportunities in the labour market, and are subject to harmful practices such as child, early and forced marriage, gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, sexual harassment and other harmful practices. Women were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including in terms of loss of jobs, income and livelihoods, while continuing to bear the disproportionate brunt of unpaid care and domestic work. Investment and a focus on the rights of women and girls are required to provide and enable access to inclusive and quality education, social protection, online health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care services, property and capital and productive assets throughout the life course; to ensure financial inclusion through expanding access to financial services such as credit; and to eliminate harmful practices and all forms of violence. Together, these actions will help to address barriers to women’s full, equal, effective and meaningful participation in all spheres of society, including in decision-making and leadership, in order to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls and further enhance the contribution of women to economic and social development. The disproportionate impact of the pandemic on the social and economic situations of women and girls, along with gender-based violence, also pose challenges to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in the least developed countries.</p>

Sustainable funding at the municipal level through additional resources is key to supporting the investment needs of growing cities in least developed countries. </p>

They can also play a key role in accelerating the pace of economic diversification and transformation, and in improving productivity and competitiveness, in a way that maximizes benefits for people, planet and prosperity and enables the full participation of least developed countries in the global economy. We underscore the urgent need to accelerate investment in the development and scaling of innovation and technology solutions for the most pressing problems that least developed countries face across economic, social and environmental fields that support their digital transition and strengthen efforts to bridge digital divides, including between rural and urban and between women and men, and build an open, free and secure digital world. We call for strengthened international cooperation to support least developed countries in strengthening science, technology and innovation, including by providing financial contributions for investment in ICT infrastructure. We also urge the strengthening of digital literacy and skills, as part of efforts to bridge digital and knowledge divides, as a prerequisite for inclusive participation in the digital economy. We also acknowledge the potential of the fourth industrial revolution to raise global income levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world, while at the same time presenting the risk of accelerating inequality within and between societies should gains be inequitably distributed.</p>

According to the Global Innovation Index rankings of 2020, 9 of the 21 least developed country economies improved their rankings, while 11 of the least developed countries covered in the Index went down the rankings. The ratio of research and development expenditure in least developed countries as a share of GDP was 0.6 per cent or less between 2011 and 2017, compared with some 2 per cent of developed countries’ much larger GDP. According to the data compiled by the World Intellectual Property Organization, from 2010 to 2018, the number of patent applications filed by residents of least developed countries doubled, from 835 to 1,634. However, as a share of patents globally, the figure is almost zero. The least developed countries published only 11 journal articles for every 1 million people in 2018. </p>

During the period of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action, Internet access in least developed countries increased to 19 per cent in 2019 from approximately 5 per cent in 2011. This progress notwithstanding, there are growing digital divides both within and among countries, including gender digital divides and rural-urban divides. These divides result from low Internet and broadband coverage, especially in rural and remote areas, the costs of using the Internet and the lack of locally relevant content and of relevant digital skills in least developed countries. Approximately 800 million people in least developed countries do not have access to the Internet and have no possibility of participating in economic, political, social or cultural activities online. Without an expansion of national digital infrastructure, the risk of least developed countries being locked into the low-equilibrium trap is likely to be accentuated.</p>

A number of developing country members have granted a significant degree of duty-free and quota-free market access to products from least developed countries and a number of them have reached nearly full duty-free and quota-free coverage. Least developed countries need to be provided with increasingly greater market access in preference-granting countries.</p>

E-commerce can take the form of business-to-business or business-to-consumer transactions, combined with secure online mobile platforms and fintech solutions fundamentally, and can profoundly reduce the matching costs by which buyers and suppliers can meet, connect and create profits within the country and across borders and facilitate access to last-mile producers and markets. This can speed up economic adjustments to shocks such as COVID-19 and many other profound economic, environmental and geopolitical shocks that a country may face in the coming years. The huge potential notwithstanding, least developed countries have been unable to sufficiently benefit from the opportunities offered by e-commerce owing to a lack of necessary digital infrastructure, logistical facilities, digital literacy and skills, and fintech solutions, as well as regulatory and policy frameworks.</p>

Adaptation and resilience in food systems, including in the sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, social protection services and livestock, are of prime importance for least developed countries and have major implications for food security, nutrition, livelihoods, especially of the most vulnerable in society, and employment. Water resources already face multiple pressures and are highly sensitive to climate change impacts such as the drying-up of sources, disruption in rainfall patterns and increased frequency of both extreme and slow-onset events, which reinforce already existing trends in land degradation and desertification. The rapid projected growth of urban populations presents challenges in the provision of services such as water and sanitation, which must develop and grow at a faster rate in order to keep pace. Localization of climate action, including support for local governments and building resilient communities, is extremely important because they understand local needs and are on the front line of climate change adaptation action, and disaster risk reduction, response and recovery. Critical infrastructure services, such as transport, water and electricity, remain highly unreliable and vulnerable to extreme climatic events. Measures to restore and improve the sustainable management of key natural resources such as water and land, as well as biodiversity, are urgently needed. </p>
