We reaffirm our commitment to prevent and combat trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. We condemn the involvement of criminal groups and unethical medical personnel in trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. We commit to adopting ethical and transparent regulations governing organ donations, strengthening legislative frameworks, including by reviewing, developing or amending them, as appropriate, to prevent and combat trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal and trafficking in human organs, including the criminalization of these practices and provisions to ensure the accountability of the perpetrators, and to resource such efforts, including the ready provision of effective and needs-based victim protection and health services. We call for better coordination and collaboration between criminal justice actors and medical professionals, and strengthened capacity and skills to proactively identify and investigate these cases. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	We reaffirm the importance of taking measures to prevent and combat trafficking in persons in supply chains, including deterring and penalizing fraudulent and abusive recruitment practices. We encourage Member States, multilateral organizations and the private sector to adopt ethical and transparent practices in their procurement and supply chains, and strongly urge them to regularly disclose and provide further access to relevant information on these practices. We are mindful of the need to ensure that all actors in global supply chains, including intermediaries, who purchase or benefit from the labour of trafficking victims, are to be held accountable, including through sufficiently stringent sanctions, through adoption and enforcement of appropriate legislation and practices. In this regard, we recall the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.<authorialNote marker="12" placement="bottom" eId="authorialNote_12"><p xml:space="preserve">	 	Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework (<a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/HRC/17/31">A/HRC/17/31</a>, annex).</p></authorialNote> We also emphasize the need to establish firewalls between immigration checks and labour inspections, and/or to ensure that labour inspections are conducted in such a way that does not put potential victims of trafficking in fear of immigration authorities or offences. We stress the importance in implementing labour standards improving government procurement practices in efforts to promote decent work and the need to develop awareness-raising and educational programmes in partnership with civil society and the media to counter any acceptance of the use of forced labour and exploitation in the production of goods. We also urge the Secretary-General to ensure that all United Nations procurement does not contain goods and services produced by trafficked persons.</p>
