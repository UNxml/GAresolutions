This long-standing interest of the Court is in line with several Assembly resolutions in which States, international organizations and institutions are encouraged to increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries.<authorialNote marker="1" placement="bottom" eId="authorialNote_1"><p xml:space="preserve">	 	See, for example, the twelfth preambular paragraph of resolution <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/74/185">74/185</a> on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law.</p></authorialNote></p>

            <p xml:space="preserve">	Unfortunately, there is no line in the budget of the Court which allows it to fund temporary stays of recent law graduates at the Court to gain working experience. The Court was therefore greatly pleased when in 1999 the New York University School of Law offered to provide fellowship awards to five of its students per year to serve as university trainees at the Court and to enable these law graduates to gain experience working under the supervision of a member of the Court. The Court accepted this offer and established a University Traineeship Programme for this purpose. Under the terms of the agreement between the Court and New York University, the University was responsible for providing a monthly fellowship award to the selected candidates for the 10-month duration of their training at the Court. </p>

            <p xml:space="preserve">	In the following years, the Court sought to expand the University Traineeship Programme to other universities. Therefore, the Court invited other universities to nominate candidates to the Programme. Thanks to these efforts, between 2002 and 2015, a number of universities joined and started to nominate candidates for the Programme. To enlarge even further the number of participating universities, participation in the Programme was opened in 2015 to all universities with law faculties, which have been invited every year since 2016 to nominate candidates through a call for applications posted on the website of the Court. </p>

            <p xml:space="preserve">	The Judicial Fellowship Programme is an apprenticeship programme which enables recent law graduates to develop their skills in the field of the peaceful settlement of international disputes through the law. It aims to improve participants’ understanding of international law and the Court’s procedures by actively involving them in the work of the Court. Each fellow is assigned to one judge for a period of around 10 months, from early September to June or July of the following year. During this period, participants attend public hearings of the Court, research and write memorandums on legal questions or factual aspects of pending cases and are involved in other aspects of the Court’s work. Each participant works alongside an associate legal officer, who is the primary legal assistant of a judge and is employed by the United Nations. </p>

The Court looks for candidates who have achieved excellent results in their law studies and who have demonstrated an interest in international law through their studies or publications. Candidates are usually in the early stages of their legal careers. In making its selection, the Court seeks to choose candidates of various nationalities. </p>

            <p xml:space="preserve">	Over the years, it has become clear to the Court that the fact that participating universities are expected to provide a stipend to the students they nominate has tended to exclude less-endowed universities, particularly those based in developing countries, from nominating candidates, thus limiting the possibility for the Court to select fellows from a number of geographical regions. As a result, otherwise eligible students, who do not attend well-endowed universities based in developed countries, do not have the opportunity to participate in the Programme. </p>

During the same period, no fellows were sponsored by universities in Africa and Eastern Europe. Only one fellow (0.5 per cent) was sponsored by a university in Latin America and the Caribbean, and eight fellows (4 per cent) were sponsored by universities in the Asia-Pacific region. Of the 193 fellows, the overwhelming majority (68 per cent) were nationals of countries of the Group of Western European and other States. Only 11 fellows (5 per cent) were nationals of Eastern European countries, 13 (6 per cent) of African countries, 17 (8 per cent) of Latin American and Caribbean countries and 30 (13 per cent) of Asia-Pacific countries. </p>

This would correct the current imbalance in the Programme which might otherwise be perceived as catering only to law graduates from a limited number of countries and the universities based therein. However, similar to any other activity involving the Court, such a mechanism should be compliant with the requirements of the Statute and Rules of the Court. Accordingly, the contemplated mechanism should not entail that the Court engages with individual Member States to mobilize contributions for its Judicial Fellowship Programme. In addition, the mechanism should not allow States who wish to support the Programme to offer or to make direct payments to the Court. </p>
