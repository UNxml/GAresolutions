                <p xml:space="preserve">	Public resources, policies and plans will be at the heart of our efforts for a sustainable development investment drive. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda emphasizes the central role of public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic public resources in financing sustainable development. Despite notable tax revenue increases in many developing countries in the first decade of the twenty-first century, recent years have seen stagnation and setbacks, amid weak global economic growth. Additionally, existing international tax rules often do not fully respond to the diverse needs, priorities and capacities of developing countries, especially the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, African countries and small island developing States, as well as middle-income countries. Mobilizing additional domestic public resources and ensuring their effective and efficient use for sustainable development impact will require decisive national action to strengthen fiscal systems, promote their progressivity, build long-term financial resilience and align them with sustainable development, including through the use of data and statistics to inform decisions. In a globalized and increasingly digitalized world, domestic efforts must be complemented by international cooperation, including through inclusive and effective international tax cooperation, improved capacity to collect revenues and robust measures to prevent and combat tax evasion, illicit financial flows and corruption. National and public development banks also have a crucial role in mobilizing investments for sustainable development. We reaffirm that national sovereignty will be fully respected, and each country has the right to choose its own national priorities and policies according to its circumstances. </p>

However, global investment growth has slowed in the last decade. Despite increased attention to innovative finance instruments such as blended finance and adoption of sustainable business and finance legislation, investment in sustainable development has not reached expectations, nor has it adequately prioritized sustainable development impact. Investment remains hampered by underdeveloped financial and capital markets in many developing countries, high cost of capital and misalignment between short-term financial incentives and long-term sustainable development impact. Competitive investment opportunities are not always aligned with public goals. This underlines the need for policy frameworks and incentives for private investment, at the national and global levels, that promote sustainable development, building on lessons learned since the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Robust action is needed to strengthen the enabling environment at all levels for long-term quality investment in sustainable development and to ensure that additional private resources are mobilized at scale and speed for developing countries.</p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	International development cooperation, including official development assistance, continues to make a significant contribution to implementing the 2030 Agenda and realizing sustainable development in its three dimensions. Recent shifts and reductions of official development assistance amid changing political priorities have put development cooperation under stress, with official development assistance commitments still falling short. South-South cooperation is a complement to, not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and has been expanding, as has triangular cooperation. Multilateral development banks, which are in a unique position to accelerate financing for sustainable development and to leverage shareholder contribution through their balance sheets, have taken significant steps to expand their financial capacity, enhance their development impact and address global challenges. But overall, development cooperation has not kept pace with rising and evolving needs of developing countries, especially in countries in special situations, as well as countries in conflict and post-conflict situations. Persistent poverty and inequality, food insecurity, disasters, adverse impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and other challenges are increasing demands on limited resources. Addressing growing fragmentation and lack of coordination is essential to respond to increasing transaction costs and uphold long-standing effectiveness principles. International development cooperation needs to reinforce developing countries’ capacities to achieve sustainable development, and address poverty eradication and hunger, catalyse the mobilization of other sources of finance, both public and private, and support countries to better manage transitions throughout their development process. This requires reinvigorating the development cooperation architecture – globally and in countries – as a basis for a more effective, inclusive, coherent and efficient cooperation and partnership that honours existing commitments, meets and adapts to emerging needs, prioritizes country leadership and local ownership, promotes transparency and mutual accountability, and focuses on sustainable development impact. </p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	International trade is an engine for inclusive growth and poverty eradication and contributes to the promotion of sustainable development. Yet, the multilateral trading system is increasingly under threat. Trade restrictions, including tariffs inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules, principles and commitments, are on the rise globally amid rising trade tensions and stalling multilateral negotiations. Developing countries, including African countries, least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and middle-income countries, with limited productive capacities and trade infrastructure, face challenges in integrating into regional and global value chains. This calls for concrete measures to improve their capacities to trade in goods and services and generate higher value addition in commodities and critical minerals, among other sectors, including through leveraging digital technologies, with a focus on the furthest behind. We take note that local currencies are used in cross-border payments, including for trade and investment, and that this can contribute to reducing vulnerabilities. While digital technology is creating new trading opportunities, development models reliant on the export of low-cost manufactured goods are impacted by automation. A universal, rules-based, fair, open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non‑discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system should contribute to the achievement of sustainable development in all three dimensions, providing policy space for national development objectives, poverty eradication and sustainable development, while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and countries’ commitments.</p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	Amid successive crises, disasters, climate and other shocks, sovereign debt challenges have become one of the greatest obstacles to realizing sustainable development. While multilateral lenders have increased concessional lending in response to these shocks, many developing countries face high debt service burdens and borrowing costs, which severely constrain their fiscal space and ability to address poverty and inequality and invest in sustainable development. While there has been some progress in reforming the sovereign debt architecture, there is significant room for improvement. When countries seek to restructure their debt, restructurings are often still late and too lengthy. As debt, when prudently managed, is an important tool for financing sustainable development investments, we must put in place a development-oriented debt architecture that enhances responsible borrowing and lending; supports developing countries to lower their cost of capital and enhance their fiscal space; achieves efficient, fair, predictable, coordinated, timely and orderly restructurings; and is based on enhanced debt transparency and reporting, and sound and transparent analysis of sovereign debt sustainability, which is crucial for the smooth functioning and fair pricing of debt markets.</p>

                <p xml:space="preserve">	From Monterrey to Sevilla, we have emphasized the importance of continuing to reform global economic governance and strengthen the United Nations leadership role in promoting development to arrive at a stronger, more coherent and more inclusive international economic and financial architecture. The international financial architecture – the existing set of international financial frameworks, rules, institutions and markets that safeguard the stability and function of the global monetary and financial systems – fundamentally shapes sustainable development outcomes. International economic and financial institutions have made significant efforts towards institutional reform, including to preserve macroeconomic stability amid major shocks, address growing financing challenges faced by developing countries, and bring the architecture into greater alignment with sustainable development. But major systemic challenges persist. With full respect for the respective mandates and governance bodies of different international institutions, additional measures are needed to ensure that governance arrangements accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of the world; the global financial safety net has sufficient depth and coverage; financial regulatory frameworks effectively address existing and new risks and financial innovations; and private credit ratings effectively perform the important function of providing accurate and long-term-oriented information to financial markets. The international community must work together to broaden and enhance the voice and representation of developing countries in international financial and economic institutions. The international financial architecture must continuously adapt to changing global realities, align with sustainable development, and respond to the needs, evolving challenges and vulnerabilities facing all countries, especially developing countries.</p>

Technological advances can also have unintended economic, environmental and social impacts, and worsen gender inequality and the exclusion of persons with disabilities, older persons and those in vulnerable situations. We recognize the importance of enabling environments at all levels, including enabling regulatory and governance frameworks, in nurturing science, innovation and the dissemination of technologies. We support the development and deployment of new and existing technologies and products that are affordable, available, equitable and accessible to all, while ensuring that the development of emerging technologies is good for all. Coordinated national and international efforts are needed to leverage scientific and technological advances for sustainable development, close digital divides and realize the full potential of digital technology and the use of data in achieving financial inclusion and financial health. We call for enhanced international support for targeted capacity-building in science, technology and innovation in developing countries. </p>

Stronger efforts are needed to enhance disaggregated data, accessibility and innovative data sources, with adequate safeguards to address privacy and data protection. Political momentum is also growing for measuring progress in sustainable development using metrics that complement or go beyond gross domestic product, including multidimensional vulnerability. This reflects a broader recognition that relying solely on economic or income-based indicators such as gross domestic product and gross national income fails to capture the full complexity of countries’ development realities, structural vulnerabilities and needs. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda strengthened the financing for development follow-up process; however, challenges remain. Building on experiences since 2015, steps must be taken to further enhance follow-up at all levels in concrete ways, including improving engagement of all relevant stakeholders, and the incorporation of national and regional perspectives into the global dialogue. </p>
