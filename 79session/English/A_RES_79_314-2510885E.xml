A healthy, productive and resilient ocean is essential for a sustainable ocean-based economy, food security and nutrition, and underpins deep cultural and social connections.

We recall that article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement states that it will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. We also emphasize the need to adapt to the unavoidable effects of climate change. We welcome the decisions adopted during the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in particular the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, in particular the UAE Consensus and its first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, and the twenty-ninth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, in particular the decision on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance.
