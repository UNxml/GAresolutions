Their inherent geographical and structural constraints related to the lack of direct territorial access to the sea, obstacles to transport and communication, long distances from major markets, cumbersome transit procedures and inadequate infrastructure are further exacerbated by unprecedented global challenges and crises, including the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID‑19) pandemic, geopolitical tensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high transportation and trade costs, high interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate change, biodiversity loss, desertification and pollution. </p>

The world is plagued by growing poverty, hunger and malnutrition, inequalities, human rights violations, digital divides within countries and between developed and developing countries, vaccine inequity, complex humanitarian emergencies and armed conflict, insecurity, pandemics, environmental degradation, climate change and disasters. The situation for landlocked developing countries is particularly bleak. The situation demands urgent mobilization of our collective resources, decisive actions by all and innovative solutions to the unprecedented challenges. In this context, we strongly reaffirm our unwavering commitment to work tirelessly for the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals in a balanced and integrated manner in its three dimensions, including by taking tangible steps and calling for greater action and extraordinary measures by all countries; and strengthened international and multilateral cooperation to support the landlocked developing countries in this endeavour and to reach the furthest behind first. </p>

We note with concern that the severe financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity constraints also undermined progress. Additionally, adverse global economic conditions characterized by tepid growth, surging inflation, increased pressure on energy, food and finance, supply chain disruptions and elevated trade costs continue to affect the recovery efforts of landlocked developing countries. Furthermore, landlocked developing countries were significantly affected by disasters, many of which are exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss and disasters, such as desertification, recurrent droughts, melting glaciers, floods and glacier lake outburst floods. </p>

Approximately 54 per cent of landlocked developing countries’ land is classified as dryland and 60 per cent of the population in those countries are located in these drylands. In addition, many of the landlocked developing countries are mountainous countries, making them more vulnerable to the impact of climate change and environmental degradation that is also exacerbated by climate change.
